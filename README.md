## History

In 2008 I needed a tool like this and ended up with DataHack made by Richard Tardivon. Soon I  started fiddling with the program and after a few months I decided to fork it under the name of DataDigger. Build 13 of 13 jan 2010 was the first that appeared on the OpenEdge Hive. Starting with v19 the home of the DataDigger is at GitHub.
